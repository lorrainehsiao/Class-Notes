<b>Professor Stark</b>
<li>presented at SANSI
<li>Magnitude-dependent Automatic Alarms
<li>ETAS, based on probability models
<li>Applications of the Rabbit-Hat Theorem
<br>Can't turn a rate into a probability without assuming the phenomenon is random in the first place
<br>Cannot conclude that a process is random without making assumptions that amount to assuming that the process is random
<li>Seismicity models
<br>Poisson doesn't fit: too little clutering
<br>Poisson, when looking at disjoint regions, no memory
<br>applied to "main event", but what is definition of "main event"?  Tried to decluster and remove aftershocks
<li>testing if the empirical cdf fits a uniform (straight diagonal)
<br>perform a test to find the distribution for the maximum difference between empirical and theoretical
<li>dissertation paper: didn't use a distribution, fit a model to the data,can't use Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
<li>Automatic Alarms and MDAs
<br>Automatic alarm: after every event with M > mu, start an alarm of duration tau, no free parameters
<br>Magnitude-dependend automatic alarm (MDA): after every event with M > mu, start an alarm of duration tau*mu^M with 1 free parameter (mu)
<li>ETAS Epidemic-type Aftershock sequence
<br>Gutenberg-Richter law for magnitudes N proportional to 10^(-b*M), best fitting b varies regionally, typically different in aftershock sequences from "overall" best b
<br>fitting ETAS to data: maximum likelihood
<br>building likelihood function, usually through EM model (knowing labels, let's maximize likelihood)
<br>optimal predictor of stochastic process: conditional intensity
