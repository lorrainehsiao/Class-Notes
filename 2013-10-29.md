<h2>White Board</h2>

<h3>Complicated to Complex</h3>
<b>Data Curators</b>
<ul>
<li>deciding time period
<li>deciding geographic area
<li>formats
<li>data sources
</ul>


<b>Analyzer</b>
<ul>
<li>ETAS model
<li>pull from data curators
<li>inputs to model
</ul>

<b>Visualizers</b>
<ul>
<li>dynamic graphs (what kind)
<li>tools to use (ipynb, d3)
</ul>

<b>Presentors</b>
<ul>
<li>connecting the groups
<li>big picture
<li>listen to others' story
<li>output format to others
<br>NEXT TUESDAY: presentation to class that is sufficient to audience
</ul>

<h3>Better Picture</h3>
No worry and confusion -> ambiguity and questions
<br>Define, carve, SMART goals
<br>ETAS (epidemic type after shock)- disease based 
<br><ul>
<li>model generates curves that fit this model
<li>4 input parameters
</ul>

<h2>Abstract/What We're Doing</h2>
ETAS is an arbitrary application of an epidemic model to earthquakes.
<br>We want to create a simpler model that can make the same predictions.
<br>Create a model simpler than ETAS that makes the same (or better) predictions.
<br>Is our candidate model the same?
<br>Definitively define whether the model is better, the same, or worse.
<br>Working groups: can be people within the core, or with other people
