===========
Poisson process used for earthquakes, used for memoryless trait.  After an earthquake, the amount of time that you have to wait will still be the same.  Brownian passage time: when you pass a threshold there is an earthquake

USGS prediction: 0.7 +- 0.1
  Why should we believe their opinion over anyone else's?

Process: 
  Stage 1: Map how much the ground is moving during the year.  Calculate a 'slip factor' to see how much of the movement is aseismic.  Reality is like a draw from a hat, and average values of parameters is what they think it is, with the differences being Gaussian.  Generate 2000 models, estimating long-term seismicity rates as a function of magnitude for each seismic source.
  Stage 2: Fit 3 types of stochastic models for earthquake reference

Problems:
  Unknown what the answer is supposed to mean
  They equate frequencies with probabilities.  Outcomes seem to be likely for no particular reason.  
  Calibrated using data that are not communsurate.

Urn Theory:
  Full of black and white marbles.  Stir.  Pick one out, if black then something bad happens.  If white, then nothing happens.  Sampling with or without replacement?
  Why does it have to do with natural disasters?  Arguments become about the rules of the card game.
  Confusing the fact that there is a mean with the fact that the list is random

Rabbit Hat Theory:
  Can't assume a process is random unless you make these assumptions first, and then test it.
  Assume failure times are random.  Uncorrelated failures isn't enough to give uniformity.  
  Case 2 adds a random time to a mean m.

Null Hypothesis for testing predictions: how often will my predictions have worked?
  Poisson seismicity, historical rates (predict no uncertainty in it), predictions fixed
  Poisson seismicity after 'declustering', historical rates, prediction fixed
  Locations from catalogs, times uniform (model where time is uniform), predictions fixed
  Locations from catalogs, times permuted, predictions fixed

Analogous to Weather Prediction
  My predictions are better than if I assigned dates at random.  Null: predictions are better than chance.
  Problem: what chance?
